The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.<br>
I have all required software.<br>
I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.<br>
# Stakeholders
Professor - for grade<br>
Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud<br>
Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job<br>
Current Employer - Would like me to use any skills learned that could help at worksite.
