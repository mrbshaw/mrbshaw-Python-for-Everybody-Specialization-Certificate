Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)
Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)
Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)
