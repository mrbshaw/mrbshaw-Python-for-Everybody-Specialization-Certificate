# Personal Project 1 - Problem Statement-Python-for-Everybody-Specialization-Certificate <br>
# Goals
Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization <br>
Become more comfortable writing code. <br>
Use knowledge to do well in COP1500. 
# Boundaries / Scope
Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)<br> 
Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures<br>
# Success criteria <br>
My own application for data retrieval and processing. Then to use this to make an application to help track our residents at work.<br> 
Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.
#  Constraints
I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.<br> 
Or spend the money for the course so I can earn certification. Monthly billing. 
# Assumptions
If I keep up with it, I won't be overwhelmed.<br>
The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.<br>
I have all required software.<br>
I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.<br>
# Stakeholders
Professor - for grade<br>
Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud<br>
Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job<br>
Current Employer - Would like me to use any skills learned that could help at worksite.
